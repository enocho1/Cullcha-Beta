<h1>Why Takeshi's Castle is the greatest gameshow of all time.</h1>

<p>I love a good game show. You don’t choose to watch it, but if it is on, you’ll watch it. The quiz ones make me feel clever if I get an answer right, and then I can berate the guy on tv for being an idiot. When I get it wrong, I just keep quiet and nobody knows I’m the idiot. It’s the perfect oceans 11 set-up.</p>
<p>But I have an admiration of those who compete in Takeshi’s Castle - you know it’s not serious. It’s like sometimes someone really cocky goes on Ninja Warrior and deep down you want them to plummet face-first in the water, but the guy completing the course in the lobster outfit becomes a god, deserving of all things the title of ninja warrior bestows upon him.</p>
<p>The premise of Takeshi’s Castle is this: General Lee wants to overthrow Takeshi, hiding in his stronghold, and does so leading an army of willing warriors into battle against the ridiculous games and the evil guards that stand in their way. The winner gets 1 million yen (around £6,000), though there’s only been 7 winners in 133 episodes due to how unbelievably hard it is.</p>
<p>There’s even a "Fighting spirit award" of 100k yen for whoever’s most entertaining, resulting in people sliding down white water rapids in a red teacups dressed as cows. Or what about contestants wearing velcro outfits swinging onto a velcro wall in an attempt to stick on to it, or American football with sumo suits? And this is all in the first episode.</p>
<p>Researching this show – and by researching I mean watching tv all day – I’ve ventured into a whole cultish world filled with everything Takeshi. The UK narrator, Craig Charles, called those loyal fans ‘Keshi heads’, and while I can’t say I’m a total Keshi head, I appreciated the devotion. They even have their own insanely detailed fandom page. I feel like this bordering obsession of obscure media culture is exactly what the internet was made for.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, reading someone else saying something’s good can never match the experience of doing something yourself. So this website is now redundant. Have fun watching Takeshi’s Castle. </p>
