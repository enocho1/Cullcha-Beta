<h1>Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a masterpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>

  <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has entertained us for over a decade. Even as a comic book fan myself, with its 23 films (as well as some shorts!), even I can admit there are some misses. In fact, I found a few films recently a little underwhelming, but that's a story for another time. There is however, one MCU film that I can rewatch wherever and whenever - Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Why is Captain America 2 the best MCU film? Why is it one of the first films I think of when asked of my favourite? Why have I rewatched it more times than I care to admit? Because it's awesome of course but let me explain.</p>
  <p>While the film IS better If you've seen the eight MCU movies before it, and there are hints to future films, it doesn't feel like just a stepping stone or filler towards the next team-up movie; it's its own thing. The plot is intriguing by itself and you feel invested from the get-go without it needing to be about Thanos (I got so bored of the "Infinity Saga" by the end of it but that's a whole other thing).</p>
  <p>The characters are perfect: Captain America Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans was perfectly cast, as has been shown throughout the past decade. However, The Winter Soldier is by far his best outing. Heroic, with that goodie-two-shoes attitude from his last two outings, but he's seen enough to be willing to bend the law for the greater good. His suit is awesome too. Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie also has a great introduction to the MCU and provides some comic relief throughout, and it's always nice to see Nick Fury in more than a cameo. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is played well as a solid partner to Steve, and actually had a reasonable amount to do unlike in many of her Avengers appearances. Now onto the Winter Soldier himself (gonna give him his own little paragraph).</p>
  <p>Bucky Barnes (spoilers, sorry) has literally never been cooler in the MCU. I know this movie was sick because of how lame he seems in every other movie. No Shade on Sebastian Stan - I think he plays the character well - But he's never been as menacing or physically intimidating since. A violen russian killing machine with long hair, dark eye shadow and a metal arm. Now he's all conditioner and no eye shadow, his arm is new though be barely uses it and he's not a villain, he went from one of my favourite characters to meh after just one appearance (he was actually decent in Civil War, but that's coming later).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you mix all of that, With believable, villains, great action sequences (like really, really great. Look up "Winter Soldier Highway Fight" on YouTube and tell me I'm wrong), An inspiring score, and a few cheesy - but nonetheless hype-inducing - monologues and one-liners, you've got (and I'm like 87% sure, I think) my favourite movie ever.</p>
       <p>Look, I know I didn't say much - I'm new to this blog-writing thing - but this movie is without a doubt good and maybe (with a teenie tiny bit of doubt) Incredible, so just give it a watch if you haven't, and if you have, give it a rewatch and tell me it's not perfect as the first time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
