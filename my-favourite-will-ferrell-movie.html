       <h1>My favourite Will Ferrell movie.</h1>

<p>Will Ferrell is one of the most famous comedic actors of the last couple of decades. He's Starred in loads of modern comedy classics like Anchorman, Step Brothers and... uhh, Get Hard? Obviously I'm not bashing these movies, I've laughed at many a film in Ferrell's mostly comedic filmography. It's just that I personally wouldn't call any of those "very good". They are filled with dead space where the jokes aren't hitting or the story isn't that interesting (Anchorman 2 is probably the worst offender with like a 20% joke hit-rate). A lot of the comedy is in how bad the jokes or production value are.</p>
<p>"But Megagmind!" I hear you complain. I'm ignoring this animated family film for now, but we'll definitely break down that masterpiece at some point in the future. I'm just looking at his live-action outings at the moment. Anyway, that first paragraph was just a long way of saying, while I find Will Ferrel funny, I think most of his movies are less than great. However during a long quarantine with just one housemate, after a couple of months, we stumbled upon what I think is the best Will Ferrell film ever.</p>
<p>Stranger Than Fiction (2006) Stars Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah. It's basically about a super-average Joe - called Harold - who wakes up one day to find his monotonous life ominously narrated by Karen Eiffel (Thomopson), a british writer. The narration can only be heared by him and it describes everything he does. I won't spoil the film, but the question of whether the narration is in control of his life gives the film a lot of its tension.</p>
<p>What I love about this movie compared to other Will Ferrell films is his character. He's not playing an idiot. in fact Harold Crick is written as being quite intelligent. He's not cracking Jokes left and right, but it's easy to like and root for the guy - and there are some genuine laughs along the way. Ferrell's Character starts off as pretty plain, but as he tries to figure out what type of story he's in, he grows into an actual person with hobbies, goals and interests. The film doesn't have gags in every scene and at times it can feel slower if you're used to Ferrell's other stuff, but seriously it's great. It's chill, with a bit of humour sprinkled throughout and actual good acting from everyone. The story and its characters keep you invested in the film. While I haven't said a whole lot about the other characters (who were excellent) to avoid spoiling the movie, I hope you give this movie a go if you're looking for something feel-good, or if you think (as I once thought) that all live-action Will Ferrell movies are hot trash, 'cus they aren't :)</p>
