<h1>Whatever happened to Jedward?</h1>
	<p>Tom - Xth June 2020</p>

<p>Essentially the epitome of cheese talent shows with a mass ironic following them. And one question that countless leading philosophers have been asking themselves since those important Greek ones. Genuinely it’s a very good question. And I don’t think many people have the answer.</p>
<p>Maybe google it? Just don’t bing it you monster, and bings not even a verb. Though no one wants to know what individually John or Edward’s doing - has to be the collective mega power ranger that is Jedward. And John really gets shafted with the whole name thing, doesn’t he? He could be Jack, or Jay, or maybe just J – literally anything beginning with J but Edward gets his whole name. I wonder if there’s still some tension there that they didn’t stick with the original Johnward.</p>
<p>Turns out they’ve recently made a musical comeback, and in 2019 they signed with Universal Media Singapore, releasing their fourth album called ‘Voice Of A Rebel’ that June. Yes, fourth. You’ve missed out on three albums but now’s the time to catch up. So for your pleasure I’ve listened to said album in its entirety so you will never have to.</p>
<p>I mean it started ok. Then it got less ok. Then a little more less ok. The opening song, ‘Soul Crushing’, isn’t amazing, but it isn’t bad. Just imagine Capital FM’s budget gets lowered a bit – ok maybe a lot a bit. The other 21 songs sound basically the same but different. Though it’s much better music than I can make and I’m sure they’re having fun. I think the conclusion is that the idea of Jedward’s music is much better in principle than it being available.</p>
<p>So should you listen to it?</p>
<p>Not for fun, but then also a really high-pitched mayBE? </p>
